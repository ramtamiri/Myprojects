My Apache2 Server Project with Ansible! ðŸš€

Iâ€™m excited to share my latest project, where I've set up an Apache2 server using Ansible for automation! This experience has enhanced my understanding of server management and configuration.

ðŸ”§ Key Features of My Playbook:
Automated Installation: The playbook installs the Apache web server on all targeted hosts, ensuring a consistent setup across environments.
File Management: It copies a custom index.html file to the server's web root, setting appropriate ownership and permissions for secure access. This ensures that my web page is properly served to users.
